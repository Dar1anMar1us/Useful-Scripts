  .SYNOPSIS
    PoC PowerShell script to demo how to perform password spraying attacks against 
     user accounts in Active Directory (AD), aka low and slow online brute force method.
    Only use for good and after written approval from AD owner.
    Requires access to a Windows host on the internal network, which may perform
     queries against the Primary Domain Controller (PDC).
    Does not require admin access, neither in AD or on Windows host.
    Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) are not required.
    
    Should NOT be considered OPSEC safe since:
    - a lot of traffic is generated between the host and the Domain Controller(s).
    - failed logon events will be massive on Domain Controller(s).
    - badpwdcount will iterate on user account objects in scope.
    
    No accounts should be locked out by this script alone, but there are no guarantees.
    NB! This script does not take Fine-Grained Password Policies (FGPP) into consideration.
  .DESCRIPTION
    Perform password spraying attack against user accounts in Active Directory.
  .PARAMETER Pass
    Specify a single or multiple passwords to test for each targeted user account. Eg. -Pass 'Password1,Password2'. Do not use together with File or Url."
	
  .PARAMETER File
    Supply a path to a password input file to test multiple passwords for each targeted user account. Do not use together with Pass or Url.
	
  .PARAMETER Url
    Download file from given URL and use as password input file to test multiple passwords for each targeted user account. Do not use together with File or Pass.
	
  .PARAMETER Admins
    Warning: will also target privileged user accounts (admincount=1.)". Default = $false.
  .EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\Spray-Passwords.ps1 -Pass 'Summer2016'
    1. Test the password 'Summer2016' against all active user accounts, except privileged user accounts (admincount=1).
  .EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\Spray-Passwords.ps1 -Pass 'Summer2016,Password123' -Admins
    1. Test the password 'Summer2016' against all active user accounts, including privileged user accounts (admincount=1).
  .EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\Spray-Passwords.ps1 -File .\passwords.txt -Verbose 
    
    1. Test each password in the file 'passwords.txt' against all active user accounts, except privileged user accounts (admincount=1).
    2. Output script progress/status information to console.
  .EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\Spray-Passwords.ps1 -Url 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZilentJack/Get-bADpasswords/master/BadPasswords.txt' -Verbose 
    
    1. Download the password file with weak passwords.
    2. Test each password against all active user accounts, except privileged user accounts (admincount=1).
    3. Output script progress/status information to console.

    - 1.00: Initial public release, 26/06-2016
    Tested on:
     - WS 2016 TP5
     - WS 2012 R2
     - Windows 10
    Known Issues & possible solutions/workarounds:
     KI-0001: -
       Solution: -
    Change Requests for vNext (not prioritized):
     CR-0001: Support for Fine-Grained Password Policies (FGPP).
     CR-0002: Find better way of getting Default Domain Password Policy than "NET ACCOUNTS". Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy is not en option as it relies on RSAT.
     CR-0003: Threated approach to test more user/password combinations simultaneously.
     CR-0004: Exception or include list based on username, group membership, SID's or the like.
     CR-0005: Exclude user account that executes the script (password probably already known).
    Verbose output:
     Use -Verbose to output script progress/status information to console.
